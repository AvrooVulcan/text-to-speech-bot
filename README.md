# Text-to-Speech Bot

A simple Discord bot written in Node.JS with the Discord.JS library to turn text messages into audible mp3 messages.

## Setting up the bot

Download the repository via git, or download it as a zip file and extract it.

```git
git clone https://github.com/AvrooVulcan/text-to-speech-bot
```

Then go into the config.json file and enter your bot token. That is all you have to do!


## Usage

To use the bot, simply run the following command from the project's root folder.

```bash
node app.js
```

Alternatively, you can use the [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) package to ensure the bot remains running even after a crash.
